 ### Inspiration: Water Surface Analogy for the G₂-Force Hypothesis

The hypothesis was inspired by an experiment with a **water surface**:
- **Steel pin (mass *M*)** → Represents **matter** (e.g., Earth).
- **Large polystyrene sphere (PS)** → Analogous to **bulk antimatter**.
- **Ground PS particles** → Represent **antihydrogen** (individual antimatter atoms).

#### Key Analogies:
1. **2D "Spacetime"**:
   - The water surface is a **2D universe ("D-2")** for *hypothetical beings* living on the pin. Their perceived "gravity" results from surface curvature.
   - **For these beings, the pin is their entire Earth**.

2. **Forces**:
   - **G₁**: True gravity from the 4D universe (perceived as *dark energy* by the pin-beings).
   - **G₂**: Adhesion forces:
     - *Pin*: Hydrophilic attraction (**presses the pin deeper**, increasing curvature).
     - *PS*: Hydrophobic repulsion (**pushes PS upward**, creating a "hill").

3. **Antimatter Behavior**:
   - **Large PS spheres** (bulk antimatter): Net curvature forms a **hill** (G₂ > G₁).
   - **PS particles** (antihydrogen):
     - Their mass (*M₁*) is negligible for curvature (G₁ ≈ 0).
     - Dominant **hydrophobic G₂** tries to push them out of the pin’s "gravity well".
     - Observed as **apparent attraction** to the pin (they cannot escape the local depression).

   - *Note*: The pin naturally centers itself due to minimized potential energy.
